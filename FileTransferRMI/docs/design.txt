RMI File Transfer System Design
-------------------------------
A. Client/Server Design: Stateful communication with session management.
B. Server Creation Semantic: Singleton server instance to handle requests.
C. Persistent and Transient Communication: Persistent for large files (chunked) and transient for small files.
D. Synchronous Request/Reply: Client sends a request and waits for a reply.
E. Call Semantics: Each remote method is executed at most once.
F. Single Centralized Server: Designed for one server instance (future scope for load balancing).
G. Multi-threading: Server supports concurrent client requests.
H. Per-Call Workload: Considerations for caching to reduce repetitive work.
I. Reply Caching: Planned caching for idempotent procedures.
J. Timeout Values: Managed through configuration with potential for adaptive timeouts.
